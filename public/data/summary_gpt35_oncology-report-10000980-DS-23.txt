The patient is a female with a significant medical history including CAD, HTN, HLD, T2DM, CKD stage IV, and PVD. She presented with lower left leg numbness and pain, and an ultrasound revealed bilateral deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the posterior tibial veins. The patient was treated with a heparin drip and experienced several bleeding events during her stay, including an upper gastrointestinal bleed. The bleeding was managed by GI consultation and an EGD, which showed gastritis and superficial ulcerations. The heparin drip was stopped and restarted once her bleeding resolved.

The patient also developed a large left antecubital hematoma, likely due to phlebotomy and anticoagulation. The hematoma improved with holding the heparin drip and was stable at discharge. The patient's inpatient medications included lisinopril, allopurinol, atorvastatin, carvedilol, clopidogrel, furosemide, ranitidine, aspirin, multivitamins, vitamin D, and nifedipine. Her discharge medications included allopurinol, aspirin, atorvastatin, carvedilol, 70/30 insulin, lisinopril, multivitamins, nifedipine, vitamin D, docusate sodium, gabapentin, pantoprazole, senna, warfarin, nitroglycerin, furosemide, polyethylene glycol, and acetaminophen.

The patient will need outpatient hypercoagulability workup, including screening colonoscopy and mammogram. She will also need to complete an 8-week course of high-dose PPI for the upper GI bleed. The patient's hypertension medications were adjusted after the bleeding events, and she will follow up with her cardiologist. She will continue on warfarin for at least 3 months and will follow up in clinic for anticoagulation management. Transitional issues include addressing the patient's home environment for fall risk and ensuring outpatient anticoagulation management upon discharge from rehab.

The patient was discharged to an extended care facility. The primary diagnosis was deep vein thrombosis, and secondary diagnoses included upper GI bleed, left arm hematoma, superficial thrombophlebitis in the left antecubital fossa, CKD stage IV, peripheral vascular disease, T2DM, and CAD. The patient's mental status was clear and she was alert and coherent at discharge. Follow-up instructions were provided, but the specific details are not included in the summary.
