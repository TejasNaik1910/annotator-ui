The patient is a female with a medical history significant for breast cancer with BRCA1 gene mutation, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cerebral aneurysm, sleep apnea, depression, hyperlipidemia, antiphospholipid syndrome with a history of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), diabetes mellitus type 2, cerebrovascular aneurysm, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), diverticulosis, colon polyps, and various surgical interventions. She presented with severe pain and swelling in her right lower extremity (RLE) after having a lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy for breast cancer. Prior to the procedures, she had severe pain in her RLE similar to her current symptoms and had a negative DVT ultrasound. She had been wearing compression stockings and elevating her leg to relieve the pain. On examination, she had tenderness in her right calf and thigh and nonpalpable pulses in her right foot, which initially raised concerns for a pulseless extremity. She had been taking Tylenol and tramadol for pain relief with minimal effect. Diagnostic tests including a DVT ultrasound and CT scan of the RLE did not find evidence of deep venous thrombosis. The patient underwent an ultrasound-guided steroid injection of the right trochanteric bursa, which improved her symptoms. She was discharged with medications including gabapentin, lidocaine patches, tramadol, acetaminophen, albuterol inhaler, atorvastatin, docusate sodium, omeprazole, polyethylene glycol, furosemide, erythromycin eye ointment, and her home medications. She was instructed to follow up with her primary care doctor and consider an MRI of her spine to investigate the cause of her leg pain. The patient's iron levels were found to be deficient, and she received an IV iron infusion during her hospital stay. She was advised to continue taking her warfarin for her antiphospholipid antibody syndrome and to have her INR levels monitored. In summary, the patient was diagnosed with right trochanteric bursitis, right anterior leg pain, and right-sided varicose veins. She also had iron deficiency anemia, a history of DVT/PE, antiphospholipid antibody syndrome, subtherapeutic INR, and vitamin D deficiency.
