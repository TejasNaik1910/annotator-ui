**History of Present Illness:**
- The patient, a male with a history of L3-S1 lumbar decompression and right hip replacement, presented with worsening lower back and left hip pain post-surgery. MRI revealed an epidural abscess and osteomyelitis, leading to his transfer for spine consultation and treatment.

**Diagnostic Tests and Findings:**
- **MRI Spine Lumbar:** Epidural abscess, osteomyelitis, destructive changes in L4 vertebral body, and abnormal enhancements in L1-L2 vertebral bodies and sacrum.
- **Head Ultrasound:** Vascular soft tissue masses in the left forehead, concerning for bone metastases.
- **Liver Ultrasound:** Diffuse heterogeneity and masses in the liver, suggestive of cholangiocarcinoma or metastatic disease.
- **CT Head:** Right distal M1 segment MCA aneurysm, lytic and soft tissue lesions in the left frontal calvarium.
- **CT Chest:** Pulmonary nodules, esophageal wall thickening, small pleural effusion.
- **CT Abdomen/Pelvis:** Multiple hepatic masses, adrenal mass, lymphadenopathy, and large destructive mass in L4 vertebral body.
- **MRI/MRA Brain:** Calvarial lesions, acute/subacute infarct, bilateral MCA aneurysms.
- **CTA Head:** Multiple aneurysms, expansile erosive masses.
- **Dynamic L-Spine XR:** Fracture at L4.
- **MR Spine:** Enhancing mass at C2/C3, severe central canal narrowing.
- **TTE:** Small PFO, normal biventricular function.
- **Bilateral Lower Extremity Ultrasound:** No DVT.

**Pathology:**
- Skull lesion biopsy confirmed metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma.

**Medications:**
- **Admission:** Lisinopril, Lamotrigine, Atenolol, Amlodipine, Atorvastatin, Multivitamins, Omeprazole, Hydrochlorothiazide, Oxycodone, Fish Oil.
- **Discharge:** Acetaminophen, Aspirin, Docusate Sodium, Gabapentin, Oxycodone SR, Senna, Atorvastatin, Amlodipine (held), Atenolol, Fish Oil, Hydrochlorothiazide, Lamotrigine, Lisinopril, Multivitamins, Omeprazole, Oxycodone (Immediate Release).

**Hospital Course:**
- The patient was found to have metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) with multiple metastases, including spinal and skull metastasis, subacute CVA, bilateral MCA aneurysms, and a C2/3 mass with cord impingement. He started palliative radiation therapy and was scheduled for outpatient follow-up with oncology to discuss prognosis and treatment options.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
1. Metastatic Hepatocellular Carcinoma
2. Spinal Metastasis
3. MCA Aneurysms
4. Subacute Stroke
5. C2/3 Mass with Cord Impingement

**Discharge Condition:**
- Mental Status: Clear and coherent.
- Level of Consciousness: Alert and interactive.
- Activity Status: Ambulatory with assistance.

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Continue all medications and keep follow-up appointments with oncology, neurosurgery, and neurology. Consider GI follow-up for EGD if within goals of care. Smoking cessation counseling provided.

**Follow-up:**
