Summary: 
The patient is a middle-aged woman with a history of bladder cancer who underwent several surgeries, including a cystectomy and hysterectomy, and now has an ileal conduit. She presented with subjective fevers, lethargy, and bloody drain output. A CT scan showed large pelvic fluid collections, and a drain was placed and later removed. The patient also had a pulmonary embolism and acute renal injury, which were managed with anticoagulation and resolved during her hospital stay. Other chronic issues include a breast mass and hypothyroidism. The patient received blood transfusion for anemia and was started on IV antibiotics for the fluid collections. She was discharged with instructions to follow up with infectious disease, as well as her other specialists, and to continue anticoagulation and other medications. The patient's condition improved during her hospital stay, with resolution of fever and leukocytosis. Transitional issues include further evaluation and management of the breast and lung/peritoneum lesions, repeat imaging, and ongoing urology follow-up for worsening hydronephrosis.
