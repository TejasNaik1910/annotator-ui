The patient is a female with a history of metastatic cancer of unknown primary, involving her lungs and liver, presenting with shortness of breath. Her medical history includes high-grade small bowel obstruction, carcinoid tumor, hyperlipidemia, vitamin B12 deficiency, cervical degenerative joint disease, osteoarthritis, past surgical interventions including right lung resection, hysterectomy, and right arm surgery. Allergies are sulfa drugs, codeine, and Bactrim.

She was admitted with symptoms of acute on chronic shortness of breath, midsternal chest ache, and a chronic nonproductive cough. Despite recent edema in the lower extremities, evaluations were negative for venous thrombosis. Initial labs showed leukocytosis, anemia, elevated lactate levels, and abnormal liver function tests suggestive of liver involvement by metastatic disease. Imaging with a CT angiogram (CTA) and ultrasound confirmed metastases in the liver and lungs without evidence of embolism or other acute findings.

A percutaneous liver biopsy performed during her hospital stay confirmed the diagnosis of metastatic colon adenocarcinoma. Given the disease progression and poor functional status, chemotherapy was considered, but the care direction shifted towards comfort and symptom management after a discussion with the patient's healthcare proxy. Consequently, the patient was discharged home with hospice care in place.

Concerning findings included weakness and tenderness in the thigh and spinous areas. Despite the suspicion of metastases or cord involvement, the patient declined further imaging like MRI. She also experienced abdominal pain and a possible episode of hematemesis, for which she received gastrointestinal prophylaxis. An altered mental status was noted during her stay, possibly due to multiple factors, including hepatic encephalopathy and depression, but infectious causes were excluded.

The patient remained tachycardic, which was attributed to chronic conditions rather than acute events like pulmonary embolism or cardiac issues. Persistent leukocytosis was observed, thought to be secondary to her underlying cancer. Elevated lactate levels were also noted, likely due to hepatic infiltration.

At the time of discharge, the patient was on medications including bupropion, ondansetron, tramadol, senna, omeprazole, bisacodyl, docusate sodium, sertraline, trazodone, and polyethylene glycol. Discharge diagnosis was primary metastatic colon adenocarcinoma.

Overall, the patient was confused at times during her hospital stay, alert and interactive, but bedbound. She was instructed to return home with hospice services for supportive care, reflecting the advanced nature of her illness.
