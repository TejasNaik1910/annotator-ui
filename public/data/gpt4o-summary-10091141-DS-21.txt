- **CT Head:** No acute intracranial process
- **CT Torso:** Bilateral pleural effusions, worsening anasarca, nodular opacities
- **Labs:** Hypercalcemia, thrombocytopenia, elevated LFTs, amylase, and lipase

**Significant Labs:**
- Blood culture: Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (one set only)
- Stool: Positive for Clostridium difficile toxin

**Brief Hospital Course:**
- **Unresponsiveness/Altered Mental Status:** Episodes during HD, ruled out seizure, hypoglycemia, hypercarbia, hypotension, acute cardiac event, and PE. EEG showed toxic encephalopathy. Managed with CPAP, treated infection, and patient returned to baseline.
- **Respiratory Distress:** Resolved with CPAP and dialysis. Initial concern for pneumonia, treated for C. diff.
- **Tricuspid Valve Vegetation:** Monitored, unlikely to be new or actively infected.
- **Hypotension:** Managed by adjusting HD rates and holding antihypertensives.
- **C. Diff Colitis:** Treated with Flagyl.
- **Gastrointestinal Bleed:** Monitored, no further evidence of bleeding.
- **ESRD on HD:** Continued regular HD schedule.
- **Hypercalcemia:** Likely primary hyperparathyroidism, managed during dialysis.
- **Diabetes Mellitus:** Managed with sliding scale insulin.
- **Elevated LFTs, Amylase, and Lipase:** Monitored, likely due to volume overload or medication.
- **RUE Swelling:** Resolved, likely due to fluid shifts.
- **Thrombocytopenia:** Chronic, monitored.
- **Anemia:** Managed with transfusions and epo.
- **Hypothyroidism:** Continued increased dose of Synthroid.
- **Sarcoidosis:** Stable, recommended follow-up CT scan.
- **Asthma:** Managed with albuterol.
- **CAD:** Held antihypertensives, to be addressed outpatient.
- **Breast Cancer:** Continued anastrozole.
- **OSA:** Managed with CPAP.
