He was admitted with a submassive pulmonary embolism (PE) and atrial fibrillation (AF) with rapid ventricular response (RVR). He presented with dyspnea after being off anticoagulation due to gastrointestinal (GI) and retroperitoneal (RP) bleeding.

**Past Medical History:**
- HIV (VL <20, CD4 500s)
- Prior hepatitis B
- Septic shock with Strep viridans bacteremia
- Acute kidney injury and CVVH in severe sepsis
- CKD, stage III
- Splenic abscess post-splenectomy
- Type 2 diabetes mellitus on insulin
- Morbid obesity
- Hyperlipidemia
- Asthma
- Right medial meniscus tear
- Severe bronchitis
- MRSA colonization
- Submassive PE/DVT
- Retroperitoneal venous bleed
- Saddle PE/DVT
- Paroxysmal atrial fibrillation with RVR

**Physical Exam:**
- **Admission:** Well-developed, well-nourished, oriented x3, bilateral leg edema (R>L), scattered bruising.
- **Discharge:** Morbidly obese, no significant lesions or rashes, distal pulses palpable and symmetric.

**Pertinent Results:**
- **Admission Labs:** Notable for low hemoglobin (HGB 10.0), elevated PTT (60.9), and elevated lactate (1.1).
- **Discharge Labs:** Low hemoglobin (HGB 8.4), elevated MCV (114), and elevated LDH (551).

**Pertinent Studies:**
- **CXR:** Hypoinflated lungs, no focal consolidation.
- **Pulmonary Arteriogram:** Extensive thrombosis bilaterally, successful thrombolysis and thrombectomy.
- **TTE:** Dilated right ventricle with moderate global RV systolic dysfunction, moderate pulmonary hypertension.
- **IVC Filter Placement:** Successful deployment of an infra-renal Denali IVC filter.
- **EGD:** Duodenal ulcer with recent bleeding, successfully clipped.

**Medications:**
- **Admission:** Metoprolol, Fenofibrate, Rosuvastatin, Glargine, Liraglutide, Odefsey, Amiodarone, Prezcobix.
- **Discharge:** Warfarin, Enoxaparin, Pantoprazole, Furosemide, Amiodarone, Glargine, Insulin sliding scale, Fenofibrate, Liraglutide, Metoprolol, Odefsey, Prezcobix, Rosuvastatin.

**Discharge Diagnosis:**
1. Massive Pulmonary Embolism
2. Upper GI Bleeding post-duodenal ulcer clipping
3. Acute on chronic hypoxic respiratory failure
4. Atrial Fibrillation with RVR
5. Coronary Artery Disease
6. Acute on Chronic Heart Failure with Preserved Ejection Fraction
7. HIV
8. Hyperlipidemia
9. Diabetes Mellitus

**Discharge Instructions:**
- Take all medications as prescribed, especially warfarin (INR goal: 1.8-2.4).
- Follow up with doctors as listed.
- Monitor weight daily and seek medical attention if weight increases by more than 3 lbs.
